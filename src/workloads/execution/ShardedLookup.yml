Description: |
  This test exercises the behavior of $lookup against a sharded foreign collection.

  The workload consists of the following phases:
    1. Creating empty sharded collections distributed across all shards in the cluster.
    2. Populating collections with data.
    3. Fsync.
    4. Running targeted $lookup from a sharded collection.
